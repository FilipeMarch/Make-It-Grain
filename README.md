I was thinking on creating something... then I made a rectangle and removed all its grains, leaving it blank. 
I was having fun learning animations using Manim and this challenge provided me the some inspiration, some direction for creation. This is what I came up with.

You can change the animation and render it on your computer easily by running the python file `run_animation.py`, considering you have Manim installed on your computer.
