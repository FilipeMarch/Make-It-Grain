# Make-it-Grain
Mesh creative challenge "Make it Grain" from Mesh Discord channel: Mesh - â€˜Exploring the intersection between music, art and science'

I was thinking on creating something... then I made a rectangle and removed all its grains, leaving it blank. 
I was having fun learning animations using Manim and this challenge provided me the some inspiration, some direction for creation. This is what I came up with.

You can change the animation and render it on your computer easily by running the python file `run_animation.py`, considering you have Manim installed on your computer.

## Day Two

Is it possible to add audio to it? It would be difficult to make 8192 particles playing at the same time. I don't know how to interpret that many particles as sound, but I think that it would be interesting to see and hear those moving patterns.

Then I scaled the final grains to fit the whole screen and added a sound every time a grain is removed out of the rectangle.

Then I put everything back in the rectangle. The sound is terrible to hear, so please volume down before playing the result.

Animation code can be found on `main_day_two.py` in case you want to mess with it.
